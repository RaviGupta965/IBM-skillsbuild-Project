    <p class="para">70% of the planet is covered in water, a key resource for almost every aspect of life and a major factor in health, peace, and security across the world. SDG 6 looks to ‘ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all’ by 2030; a quite ambitious task considering that 2.3 billion people – or one-quarter of the world’s population – live in water-stressed countries. Physical water scarcity refers to the lack of sufficient water in an area, whereas economic water scarcity occurs when people cannot afford access to water. The consequences are disproportionately felt by the poorest and most vulnerable. Although there is no international mandate, governments around the world have implemented policies and strategies to help tackle the issue. In this article, we explore some of the most common solutions to water scarcity.</p>

    <p class="para">The effects of water scarcity are glaring but are not confined to the obvious health, poverty, and disease-causing issues. According to water.org, nearly one million people die every year from water, sanitation, and hygiene-related diseases, all of which could be reduced by securing access to safe water and sanitation.</p>

    <p class="para">Water is a lifeline, not only for human survival but also for food production. According to the World Bank, agriculture accounts for 70% of all freshwater withdrawals globally and this is only expected to grow as the world population continues to grow. </p>  
        
        <p class="para">
            It is estimated that over 140 million people will be forced to migrate within their countries by 2050 due to climate change. It is estimated that around 500 million women do not have access to menstrual products or safe, hygienic spaces to use them, and 446,000 children under 5 die due to diarrhoea which is linked to inadequate WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) – equating to 9% of the 5.8 million deaths of children globally.

            <p class="para">
                Inequality in access to water can also be a catalyst to conflict. In 2013, 27 conflicts around the world were related to water, rising to 71 in 2017. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated water-related tensions by targeting civilian infrastructure. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates that 1.4 million Ukrainians now have no access to safe water, with a further 4.6 million experiencing limited access.

            In Egypt, the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam could reduce the water flowing downstream. Ethiopia is keen to fill it in just six years, causing Egypt to lose 36% of its water supply.

            “Many of the wars of the 20th century were about oil but wars of the 21st century will be about water unless we change the way in which we manage it,” said Ismail Serageldin, the former vice president of the World Bank.

        <p class="para">
            Nine out of ten natural disasters, like storms, floods, droughts, etc., are water-related. Wetlands are an integral part of biodiversity, supporting living things, the cultivation of rice, and water filtration, alongside flood control and storm protection. More than half the world’s wetlands have dried up.
